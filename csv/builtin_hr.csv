        Software","We help startups and small businesses extend their runways by connecting them with government stimulus programs, tax credits, and hiring incentives. Whew, that’s a mouthful. In simpler terms, we help founders find cash they didn’t know they were owed.

Navigating government tax credits and incentives is no easy task. Founders and business owners rarely have the bandwidth, time, or resources to pursue these programs and as a result, billions of dollars are left on the table. 

That’s where we come in. We take the guesswork out of government and pass the cash savings onto small businesses. But before we dive into how it works, let’s talk about the team that makes it all happen. 

This isn’t our first rodeo. Our founders are ex-Google employees and successful tech startup founders. Doug Ludlow, co-founder and CEO, started MainStreet as a response to the massive impact that departing big business brought on his hometown. 

The small businesses that remained didn’t survive for long and the economy declined along with them. This is the unfortunate truth for towns across the U.S., where many small businesses lack resources and struggle to stay afloat.

At MainStreet, we want to be the small business lifeline that makes a long-standing impact on our economy. And we won’t stop until we’ve helped every small business. 

The IRS bookmarks $150B in annual tax credits and incentives for U.S. companies researching and developing new products (aka “R&D”). These incentives are impactful, but they’re also complex and time-consuming. Small business owners just don’t have the capacity to cut through the red tape and claim the cash they’re owed.

That’s where we come in. We plug directly into their payroll software to see what they’re owed across dozens of credits. We take the guesswork out of government and pass the savings back to our customers. The best part? The average venture-backed startup finds $51,040 on their first call with us."

Time they could be spending growing and building their teams, working on high-level strategy, building their network, or simply enjoying much-needed time with friends and family.

That realization led us to start Double in 2018. We wanted to help people focus their time and energy on the things they had the most value doing, and set out to build a flexible, accessible, and efficient support system. By matching executives and their teams with part-time, experienced assistants and empowering them with tools to work better together, we are building towards the vision we laid out at our launch:

1) Humans first. We believe that great delegation stems from strong relationships. We're assembling the best community of executive assistants in the US and France with a wide range of experiences to support growing companies. AI can't get it right all the time, but humans and great software can.
2) Tools to boost delegation. Most people aren’t taught how to delegate, so we're building tools to empower executives to seamlessly share tasks and preferences and learn how to apply delegation best practices. Our tools also help assistants stay on track and operate more efficiently on a daily basis.
3) Accessible for executives and their teams. While Double started as a service and product for CEOs, we are now extending support to all teams. Getting time back to spend on the things that matter is crucial for executives and their company, whether that's just a couple of hours per month or 15h per week."
